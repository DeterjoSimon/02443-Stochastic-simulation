# Excercise 3
# Continuous sample space
#
# • Generate simulated values from the following distributions:
#   • Exponential distribution
#   • Normal distribution
#   • Pareto distribution, with β = 1 and experiment with different 
#     values of k values: k = 2.05, k = 2.5, k = 3 og k = 4.
#
# • Verify the results by comparing histograms with analytical results.
# • For the Pareto distribution compare mean value and variance,
#   with analytical results, which can be calculated as:
#
#   E{X} = β(k/(k-1)) for k > 1
#   E{X} = β²(k/(k-1)²(k-2)²) for k > 2
#
# • For the normal distribution generate 100 95% confidence intervals 
#   for the mean and variance based on 10 observations. Discuss the results.
